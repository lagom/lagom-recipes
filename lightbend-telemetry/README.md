# Lightbend Telemetry (Cinnamon)

[Telemetry](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/current/home.html) (also known as "Cinnamon"), part of Lightbend Enterprise Suiteâ€™s Intelligent Monitoring feature set, is a suite of insight tools that provides a view into the workings of our distributed platforms. This view allows developers and operations to respond quickly to problems, track down unexpected behavior and even tune your system. As a result, you can deploy your applications to production with confidence.

Lightbend Telemetry [integrates with Lagom](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/current/instrumentations/lagom/lagom.html) to provide circuit breaker metrics, HTTP client and server metrics, and request tracing.
