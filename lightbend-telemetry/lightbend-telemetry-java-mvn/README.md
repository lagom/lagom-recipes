# Integrating Lagom with Lightbend Telemetry (Cinnamon)

[Telemetry](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/current/home.html) (also known as "Cinnamon"), part of Lightbend Enterprise Suiteâ€™s Intelligent Monitoring feature set, is a suite of insight tools that provides a view into the workings of our distributed platforms. This view allows developers and operations to respond quickly to problems, track down unexpected behavior and even tune your system. As a result, you can deploy your applications to production with confidence.

Lightbend Telemetry [integrates with Lagom](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/current/instrumentations/lagom/lagom.html) to provide circuit breaker metrics, HTTP client and server metrics, and request tracing.

This example adapts the [instructions for integrating Telemetry into a Lagom Java service with sbt](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/current/getting-started/lagom_java.html), showing how to do the same using Maven.

## Prerequisites

The following must be installed for these instructions to work:

* Java 8
* Maven 3.3 or higher
* Bintray credentials

### Bintray credentials

Follow [these instructions](https://www.lightbend.com/product/lightbend-reactive-platform/credentials) to set up your Bintray credentials for Maven.

## Testing the recipe

Lagom has a special development mode for rapid development, and does not fork the JVM when using the `lagom:runAll` or `lagom:run` commands in Maven. A forked JVM is necessary to gain metrics for actors and HTTP calls, since those are provided by the Cinnamon Java Agent. This example uses the [`exec-maven-plugin`](https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/) to run the Lagom production server, enabling the complete set of metrics to be displayed.

You can test this recipe using 2 separate terminals.

On one terminal build and execute the service:

```
mvn install                  # builds the service and downloads the Cinnamon agent
mvn -pl hello-impl exec:exec # runs the hello service
```

The output should look something like this:

```

To try out the `hello-proxy` service call and see metrics for the HTTP endpoints, as well as the `hello` circuit breaker you can either point your browser to `http://localhost:9000/api/hello-proxy/World` or simply run `curl` from the command line like this `curl http://localhost:9000/api/hello-proxy/World`

The output from the server should now also contain metrics like this:
